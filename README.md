# Employee SQl Query

## Background
For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from a csv file, imported the csv file into a SQL database, and then I answered the following quesions down below. The skills I want to show are data modeling, data engineering and data analysis. 

## Data Engineering 
Prior to running any analysis, I had to design my schema in a way that can eaily be digested. The following steps I took are: 
1. Defined my columns for each table
2. Setting my columns to the correct data type
3. Defining Primary Keys for each table
4. Correctly referencing related tables
5. Making sure my tables are correctly related to each other
6. Used NOT NULL condition on certain columns
7. Correctly defined the value length for my columns
